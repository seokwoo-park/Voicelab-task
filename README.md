### Task brief

Instructions:

1. Create an app using ReactJs and TypeScript.
2. Based on this figma design
   (https://www.figma.com/file/ugUL4cJrfRJSBgPit0deHv/TASK?node-id=0%3A1) and
   the API from here (https://rickandmortyapi.com/) create the Rick and Morty
   characters Table.
   a. The search filter should allow to filter the characters by name or any part of
   their name.
   b. The Species and Location filters should be multiple select dropdowns.
   c. The Status filter should be a single select dropdown.
   d. The dead characters should be gray.
   e. When multiple characters are selected, the edit character button should be
   hidden.
   f. There should be an option to change the status of a character when only one
   is selected, the changes should work as:
   i. alive can be changed to dead,
   ii. unknown can be changed to alive or dead,
   iii. dead cannot be changed.
   g. The Remove characters button should remove the selected characters from
   the table.
   h. If more than two episodes exist for a given character, then show only 2
   RANDOM ones.
   i. When an input is too long use a tooltip.
3. Share your project as a GitHub and GitHub Pages link with us.
4. Good luck, and do not hesitate to ask when any question come up.
